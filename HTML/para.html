Furthermore, their length from the tip of the beak to the end of the train is 195 to 225 cm. Also, their average weight is 5 kg.  Most noteworthy, the head, neck, and breast of Peacock are of iridescent blue colour. They also have patches of white around the eyes.

   Peacock has a crest of feathers on top of the head. The most remarkable feature of the Peacock is the extraordinary beautiful tail. This tail is called a train. Furthermore, this train becomes fully developed after 4 years of hatching. The 200 odd display feathers grow from the back of the bird. Also, these feathers are part of the enormous elongated upper tail. The train feathers do not have barbs to hold the feathers in place. Therefore, the association of the feathers is loose.
        
       The Peacock colours are a result of intricate microstructures. Furthermore, these microstructures create optical phenomena. Also, each train feather ends in an eye-catching oval cluster. The back wings of the Peacock are greyish brown in colour. Another important thing to know is that the back wings are short and dull.
