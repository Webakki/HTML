        <h3>  <b> About Tree </b></h3>
      <p> <b> Here's our simple definition: A tree is a tall plant that can live for a very long time. It has a single stem or trunk and branches that support leaves. Beneath the ground, a tree has a root system that acts as an anchor and stores the water and nutrients the plant needs to grow.</b></p>
